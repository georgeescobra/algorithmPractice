ALGORITHM PRACTICE INTRO

I will have different branches for different algorithms.

Each branch will contain a README that contains notes on each of the algorithms.

All programs will be written in Python3.

Programs will contain comments for me as I learn more about Python3, meaning some of the programs will not be technically written for efficiency, but rather a way for me to deepen my understanding of Python.

ALGORITHM BRANCHES:
  1. insertion_sort
  2. selection_sort
  3. quick_sort
  4. merge_sort
  5. heap_sort
  6. binary_search_tree
  7. breadth_first_search
