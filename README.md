ALGORITHM PRACTICE INTRO

I will have different branches for different algorithms.

Each branch will contain a README that contains notes on each of the algorithms.

All programs will be written in Python3.

Programs will contain comments for me as I learn more about Python3, meaning some of the programs will not be technically written for efficiency, but rather a way for me to deepen my understanding of Python.
