THINGS LEARNED ABOUT BINARY SEARCH TREE

    -Left Subtree cotains values less than the root
    -Right Subtree contains values greater than the root
    -left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees
    -Duplicates are not allowed
        --by definition the left and right nodes but be smaller and greater respectively
        --can be implemented tho, by using the right node as <= 
    -Full Binary Tree
        -each node in the tree has exactly 2 children or 0 children
    -Complete Binary Tree
        -a binary tree is completely filled with the exception of the bottom level
    -height h of a complete binary binary tree with N nodes is at most O(log N)
    -Trees provide an efficient insertion and search
    -Trees are flexible, allowing to move subtrees with minimum effort
    
    
Each branch will contain a README that contains notes on each of the algorithms.

All programs will be written in Python3.

Programs will contain comments for me as I learn more about Python3, meaning some of the programs will not be technically written for efficiency, but rather a way for me to deepen my understanding of Python.

ALGORITHM BRANCHES:
  1. insertion_sort
  2. selection_sort
  3. quick_sort
  4. merge_sort
  5. heap_sort
  6. binary_search_tree
  7. breadth_first_search
